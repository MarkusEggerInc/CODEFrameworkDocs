# Project Description
CODE Framework is a business application development framework from the makers of CODE Magazine, Markus Egger, and EPS Software Corp.

CODE Framework consists of various components and tools that help developers with common aspects of business application development, such as simplified SOA development with various clients, or WPF development, data access, and much more. The main focus of this framework is to enable productive, flexible, and highly maintainable business application development. 

Make sure you also install the Visual Studio Extensions and Templates from the Extension Manager right within Visual Studio!

Note: Most of the CODE Framework originates in our much larger (and not free or open source) Milos Solution Platform product. This means that while the latest build is currently flagged as "beta", it actually contains mostly very mature and time-tested code that has been migrated from the Milos product. We are still in this migration process. Expect new builds with more and more components on an ongoing basis.

Documentation and articles will also be forthcoming over the next months and weeks and will be published in CODE Magazine (in print and online) and be linked to from here. We are also working on some videos and some tools and project/item templates which will make it much easier to use this framework. Please check back in a few days. We are hoping to release some of these very shortly.
