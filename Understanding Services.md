# Understanding Services in CODE Framework

One of the main features areas of CODE Framework is creating business logic and middle tiers as SOA services. SOA is the cornerstone of many modern applications, creating systems that are more maintainable, flexible, and suitable for a wide range of scenarios, ranging from Windows to Web and Mobile scenarios using a wide variety of technologies, and outperforming conventional multi-tiered applications in a range of metrics. Using CODE Framework, it also becomes easy and extremely productive to build SOA layers.

In today’s application landscape, there only seems to be one aspect that is certain: Uncertainty. Which UI technology or which mobile platform will be dominant in the years to come? We know that for business applications especially, rich Windows UIs are still very popular and the most productive type of application. We also have no doubt about the significance of Web applications in general, and HTML5 in particular. We know that iOS and Android are important mobile operating systems, and we hope Windows Phone will catch up. There also is a good chance that Windows 8 Metro will have a significant role to play. But do we know any of these for sure? And how many of these does any system have to support now or in the future? Even if you know that you want to build your application based on HTML5, which is going to be the predominant tool for building such applications a few years down the road? Or which approach to building Windows 8 Metro applications will be the one you choose?

In short: It is currently impossible to answer many of these questions now, and it’s certainly impossible to answer these questions if you are aiming for a 5- or 10- or even 20-year horizon. 20 years may seem like an extremely long time in IT, but realistically speaking, databases that have been maintained for 10 or 20 years, or business logic that has its roots in VB6 is not uncommon. In fact, one of the most common operating systems in use today (Windows XP) is now more than a decade old. Although UI choices and platforms (such as phones and slates) have changed very rapidly and will likely continue to do so, middle-tiers and databases have evolved at a much slower pace. Consider CODE Magazine as an example. The subscriber system we are using for the magazine has continually evolved over the years, but many of its components are now over a dozen years old and that is perfectly fine.

"Basing your systems on SOA and Services is the best way to deal with the uncertainties of today’s development landscape, build systems that will be maintainable for a long time, and adjust flexibly to new demands."

So how do you work productively as a developer or architect in such an environment? How can you build middle tiers, business logic, and databases in a way that will live up to the standards you set in the last decade or two, not to mention expectations in the future? How can we fulfill the expectations of a technical and economic environment where it is not acceptable to have to throw out the entire application to support the latest mobile device or browser? And how do we fulfill those expectations in a way that’s a realistically feasible approach, highly productive, creates highly flexible and exquisitely architected systems that are easy to maintain without a large squad of rocket-science-level developers, and generally promotes high quality as a goal that is easy to achieve?
