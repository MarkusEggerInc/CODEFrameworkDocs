# WPF Theme Resource Dictionary Download

Starting with version 4.0.20524.0, we have added an additional source code download file called "WPF Theme Resource Dictionaries". This is file contains a duplication of the XAML resource files used to create all the WPF themes (skins). You are already getting those files as part of the source download, but this secondary file provides simplified access to the theme resources only. This makes it easier if all you are interested is those theme files as they are easier to find than in the big source code file. 

We are hoping that this will be especially useful for graphics artists or anyone who does not want to recompile the framework but wants to get access to the theme resources for learning or reuse purposes.
